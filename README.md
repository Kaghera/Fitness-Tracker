# Workout/Fitness Tracker

Fitness Tracker allows users to create and track daily workouts and to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 

It also allows users to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, it tracks the distance traveled.
